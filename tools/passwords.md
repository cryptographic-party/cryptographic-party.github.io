# Passwords

Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ex qui quas vitae pariatur id excepturi odit, mollitia doloremque, hic nobis nulla temporibus numquam deserunt harum animi eos voluptatum accusantium vero?

## Why shouldn't I reuse my password?

Websites get hacked, databases get compromised and computers get keylogged. There are many ways for an attacker to get your password, and if you reuse your passwords you could get locked out of all of your accounts. **To keep safe on the internet, use a different password for every account**.

## What makes a good password?

As discussed previously, a good password is unique. It should not be easily guessable (e.g. not *"pet's name 123"*), should be long (8+ characters) and should include letters, numbers and symbols. The easiest way to generate a password meeting these requirements is with a tool such as [passwordsgenerator.net](http://passwordsgenerator.net/) or [diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).

Unfortunately, a password like this is not easily memorable.

## How do I remember my passwords?

You don't. Use a password manager such as [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) or [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/). You only need to remember one password which is used to decrypt the rest. Both tools include a built-in password generator to make it easy.

Keep your password database backed up on a USB flash drive (or a cloud storage service if you're particularly clumsy) and frequently change passwords.

## How do I know if I have a good password?

Make sure that your password isn't in a list such as [the 10000 most common passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/10k_most_common.txt). Alternatively use a service such as [How Secure Is My Password](https://howsecureismypassword.net/).

## Give me some examples
